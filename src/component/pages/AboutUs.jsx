            <h3>Whats is Ayurveda?</h3>
            <p>
            Ayurveda is more than just a system of medicine—it's a way of life. Rooted in nature, Ayurveda teaches us to maintain balance in our body, mind, and environment. Through personalized treatments and remedies based on an individual’s unique constitution (Prakriti), Ayurveda aims to prevent disease, promote health, and enhance overall well-being.
